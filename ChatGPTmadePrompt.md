**Prompt:**

I want to develop a Python program that creates a neural network to predict the price of an individual stock. The neural network should use historical stock price data and relevant features. Here's what I need:  

1. The program should:
   - Use Python with TensorFlow/Keras for the neural network.
   - Use pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing.
   - Allow for easy integration with APIs like Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or similar to fetch stock data.  

2. The neural network should:
   - Include layers appropriate for time series forecasting (e.g., LSTM, GRU, or dense layers for simpler models).
   - Take features such as past prices, volume, moving averages, and technical indicators like RSI or MACD into account.  

3. The program should:
   - Include a preprocessing pipeline to clean and prepare the data, including handling missing values.
   - Split data into training, validation, and testing sets.
   - Scale the data (e.g., MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler).

4. The output should:
   - Predict the stock’s closing price for a specified future date (e.g., the next day or week).
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R-squared.
   - Include a plot of predictions versus actual prices on the test set.

5. Code should be modular, with comments and explanations, so I can adjust hyperparameters, layers, and features.

Please write the complete Python code for this task. Use best practices and provide suggestions for improving prediction accuracy.
